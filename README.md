    <h1>Voice Assistant</h1>
    <p>The Voice Assistant is a simple voice-controlled application created in Python. It can understand and respond to voice commands. While this is a basic example, it can serve as a starting point for building a more advanced voice assistant with added functionalities.</p>

   <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Responds to voice commands and performs actions.</li>
        <li>Recognizes a few simple commands like "hello," "what's the time," and "goodbye."</li>
        <li>Uses the <code>SpeechRecognition</code> and <code>pyttsx3</code> libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>1. Clone the repository to your local machine:</p>
    <pre><code>https://github.com/Adi-spec-gif/Voice-assistant</code></pre>
    <p>2. Install the required libraries (SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3) if not already installed:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3</code></pre>
    <p>3. Run the Python script to start the voice assistant:</p>
    <pre><code>python voice_assistant.py</code></pre>
    <p>4. Start interacting with the voice assistant by speaking voice commands.</p>

   <h2>Customization</h2>
    <p>You can customize the voice assistant by modifying the code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add more voice commands and actions.</li>
        <li>Implement natural language processing (NLP) for understanding and responding to a wider range of user inputs.</li>
        <li>Integrate external services or APIs to expand the functionality of the assistant.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
    <p>To create a more advanced voice assistant, consider implementing the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural language processing (NLP) for understanding more complex queries.</li>
        <li>Cloud-based voice recognition services like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for better accuracy.</li>
        <li>Integration with external services like weather information, news updates, home automation, and more.</li>
        <li>Adding a wake word detection (e.g., "Hey Assistant") for hands-free operation.</li>
    </ul>
